# Terms of Use
=======

## Introduction

Firstly, thank you for considering to use `rat_hunter`. At it's core, this tool is built in the spirit of open source, and helping solve a problem in one space, and making it available for all.

This project does not aim to monetise or exploit others for the gain of it's maintainers. Hopefully, at some point in the future, this tool is rendered useless for many good reasons outside the domain of this project. But whilst you're here, using it, extending it or modifying it, please understand that there are costs to keeping it running.

## Data Source Hosting

At the time of writing, there is only one data source, being hosted by an individual at [https://findarat.com.au/](https://findarat.com.au/). I've been unable to make a solid agreement with the owner
of the site, other than what is in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ExposureSiteBot/status/1481803485662572545).

Out of respect to the maintainer of that site, please refrain from the following behaviour:

- Repeatedly querying their website, using this tool or directly via any other methods. To be explicit, repeatedly would be querying their site at any interval shorter than one query per 30 minutes. 
- Making any commercial gain out of their work, without their consent.
- Have a think about [buying them a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/matthaywarddev), as the longer this site stays up and is paid for, we all benefit. If you valued your time at say $5 per hour, and this saves you or your family an hour or two, this might help you change your mind :)

## Maintenance of this project

I've built this in my spare time, and am not a Python expert. If you have constructive suggestions, please raise them via a Github issue as I'm always keen to learn from others. Depending on how popular this project becomes, I will have to balance life commitments and getting back to people.

I will do my best to get back to you, but please be patient if the responses aren't within a day or so.
